## Projects and People

The [projects](http://opengovhacknight.org/proyectos.html) and [people](http://opengovhacknight.org/personas.html) pages are powered by [Github](https://github.com/) and [civic-json-worker](https://github.com/open-city/civic-json-worker),
a script we run every 5 minutes that fetches data from the [Github API](http://developer.github.com/).

The JSON files are backed up every hour in the [civic-json-files](https://github.com/open-city/civic-json-files) repository.

This project was forked from [Open Gov Hack Night](http://opengovhacknight.org), thanks for all their hard work.
